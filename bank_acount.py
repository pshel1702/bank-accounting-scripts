# FIXME: Add Bank Account class definition here

# You can see how this class should be used below. Make sure you
# run your code and test it out to make sure it works.

# account_1 = BankAccount()
# account_2 = BankAccount()
# account_3 = BankAccount(100)
# account_3.balance
#   >>> 100
# account_1.deposit(100)
# account_1.balance
#   >>> 100
# account_2.deposit(50)
# account_2.balance
#   >>> 50
# account_3.deposit(75)
# account_3.balance
#   >>> 175
# account_2.withdraw(10)
# account_2.balance
#   >>> 40
# account_1.withdraw(10)
# account_1.balance
#   >>> 90
# account_2.withdraw(50)
#   >>> "Invalid transaction: not enough funds to withdraw $50." 
# account_2.balance
#   >>> 40    # still 40 since the previous transaction was not successful
